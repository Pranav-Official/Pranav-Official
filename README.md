# 💫 About Me:
🚀 Hey there! I’m Pranav Prasanth — a Software Engineer from vibrant Kochi, India 🇮🇳, passionate about building smart, scalable, and impactful products that actually make life easier!<br><br>I’m currently crafting intelligent systems at a Engineering role, where I’ve worked on full-stack apps, production-grade features, and AI-driven solutions that power real-world use cases 🌍. Some of my recent adventures include architecting a trip scheduling optimizer with OR-Tools (cutting hours of manual work down to minutes ⏱️) and building dynamic, rule-driven platforms that users actually enjoy using 😄.<br><br>You’ll find me jumping between TypeScript, Angular, React, FastAPI, and Python, with a strong love for clean architecture, constraint-solving, and agentic workflows 🤖. I also dabble in LangChain and experiment with new AI integrations whenever I can!<br><br>✨ Let’s connect, code, and create something awesome — check out my projects below! 💻🔥
